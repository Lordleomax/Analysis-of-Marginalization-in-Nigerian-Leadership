This analysis aims to investigate the claims of marginalization or domination of any region in Nigerian politics.

## **Methodology**

The analysis is descriptive and covers the period from 1960 to the present day, excluding the new administration that will take office on May 29, 2023. It covers both military and democratic regimes, as they collectively form the leadership history of Nigeria. The analysis covers only the regimes of indigenous leaders.




## Dataset
The data was sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_Nigeria)

## **Key Findings**

The key findings of the analysis are as follows:

* The North as a whole has led the country for 42 years out of the 62 years of Nigeria's leadership under review, leaving the South with 20 years of leadership.
* The Vice presidency, which goes hand-in-hand with the presidency and is mostly from the opposite region to the presidency, has been dominated by the South with a total of 38 years of the 57 years of the Vice Presidency.
* The North West and South West are conspicuously absent in the whole 43 years of the Senate Presidency. They were either occupying the presidency or Vice Presidency in all of these years.
* The North still leads in the Speakership position with the North West and North East coming strong at 12 and 9 years respectively.

## **Conclusion**

The analysis above shows that there is a clear pattern of marginalization in Nigerian politics, with the North having a disproportionate share of power. This marginalization has led to resentment and conflict, and it is a major challenge that Nigeria must address if it is to build a more just and equitable society.
